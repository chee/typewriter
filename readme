when i was a teenager i got an old typewriter, it might have belonged to my
grandfather but i can't quite recall where it came from. it didn't have
correction tape, and i didn't have the patience for correcting fluid. it was
the first time i really first ever understood that writing and editing are two
different processes and to do either well they must be done separate. no
backspace. if i made a mistake i just pressed line feed and returned the 
carriage and wrote it again and sometimes i'd pull out little ripped off pieces
of paper and write them up again. having no backspace and unblocked me, and
typing them back up completely to get them right just once was when i edited.
there was another thing, too. when i used to print out my homework and delete
the file from the computer and type it up again.

so this program doesn't have a backspace. if you paste it appears as a little
floating block that you can read and you can move it about and when you are done
with it then you can close it. you can't move the text around or change it.
you can copy it out. if you make a mistake press return and type it again.

ok i guess that's it.
